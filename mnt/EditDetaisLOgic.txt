EDITDETAILS
The purpose is to update -- bio, website, location

Problem 1
    We need to get these values already in the field once we click on update

    -So we need to get access to the devCredentials

    mapStateToProps = (state) => {
        devCredentials: state.user.devCredentials
    }

We have bio, webiste and location inside devCredentials
-- We will set these values as the state of our component once it is mounted

state = {
    bio: '',
    website: '',
    location: '',
    company: ''
}

componentDidMount(){
    const { devCredentials } = this.props;
    this.setState({
        bio: devCredentials.bio,
        webiste: devCredentials.webiste,
        location: devCredentials.location
    })
}

        PROBLEM SOLVED
