** We use compose when we want to pass several store Enhancers to the store 
const store = createStore( compose(storeEnhancers) )

Store Enhancers: Higher order functions that add some extra functionality to the store 
Higher order functions: functions that take functions as parameters and return functions as value

applyMiddleware: is the only store Enhancer that comes shipped with redux

const middleware = [thunk]
const store = createStore( compose(applyMiddleware(...middleware)) )

From the Redux docs:

All compose does is let you write deeply nested function transformations without the rightward drift of the code. Donâ€™t give it too much credit!

func1(func2(func3(func4))))

compose(func1, func2, func3, func4)
